# MDBM.jl

This is a naive julia implementation of a root finding method, which can determine whole high-dimensional submanifolds (points, curves, surfacesâ€¦) of the roots of implicit non-linear equation systems, even in cases, where the number of unknowns surpasses the number of equations.

The method was originally developed in Matlab: <http://www.mm.bme.hu/~bachrathy/>

If you use the MDBM.jl package as part of your research, teaching, or other work, I would be grateful if you could cite my corresponding publication: <https://pp.bme.hu/me/article/view/1236/640>

## Remark

*This is only an alpha version of the package: it is under heavy development, soon a version with proper types and an with an interface will be released.*
